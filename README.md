# AI From Scratch

Building deep understanding of AI by implementing models from ground up. Learning neural networks, transformers, and LLMs through hands-on implementation.

## Goal

Develop the capability to build conversational AI from first principles, without relying on pre-trained models. This is a long-term learning project to gain true depth in AI fundamentals.

## Milestones

- [ ] **Milestone 1**: Simple neural network (text classification)
- [ ] **Milestone 2**: Character-level text generator
- [ ] **Milestone 3**: Word-level text generator
- [ ] **Milestone 4**: Tiny transformer model
- [ ] **Milestone 5**: Conversational AI model
